Bridging Filipino Overseas Foreign Workers (OFW) and expats from all street corners worldwide, Drive Rock Radio is the latest internet radio station, bringing listeners closer to each other.
From different music genres that suit your mood and regular programs that ordinary Pinoys can hilariously relate, Drive Rock Radio asks you to fasten your seat belt, sit back and chillax, just enjoy the ride as we drive you home wherever you may be.
So "Sakay na here!" coz it’s "Safe"… and "Soundz"..!
